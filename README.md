# JobFinderSite

This is a project for my university which  was made in a group of 3, myself included. 
We made an internet site which is supposed to be used by employers who want to hire new workforce and people searching for a job. Employers need to create their account and make an advertisement.
Future employees also need to create an account and then they can find more info about a particular employer if they find certain offer interesting.

Project was made using HTML and PHP.

We are using MySQL database.

## Note
I deleted or changed a couple of files from the final project for security reasons. (Access do database and such)

Site was made in polish because that is the language in which I am studying at my university.

The database and site is being hosted by cba.pl which means that it can go down in about a year when our subscription of their services ends.

I recommend accessing the site in Chrome browser.
